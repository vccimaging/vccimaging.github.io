<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
Despite the impressive performance of Computed Tomography (CT)
hardware, there is still a need to push the boundaries of the CT
spatial resolution. Super-resolution techniques have been widely used
in computer vision to enhance the resolution of 2D and 3D images. They
have also been introduced to improve the CT volume resolution. In this
work, we propose a flexible framework that produces a higher-resolution
3D volume from low-resolution 2D projections. This framework can be
applied to any CT data regardless of the original physical scale and
regardless of the target application. It is based on regularization by
denoising (RED) approach, where a Non-Linear Anisotropic Diffusion
filter is used as the denoiser. <br>
We demonstrate our framework on both simulated and captured data, and
show good quality reconstruction and a huge memory-footprint improvement 
in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithm.
