<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
 We present an end-to-end image processing framework for
   time-of-flight (ToF) cameras. Existing ToF image processing
   pipelines consist of a sequence of operations including modulated
   exposures, denoising, phase unwrapping and multipath interference
   correction. While this cascaded modular design offers several
   benefits, such as closed-form solutions and power-efficient
   processing, it also suffers from error accumulation and information
   loss as each module can only observe the output from its direct
   predecessor, resulting in erroneous depth estimates. We depart from a
   conventional pipeline model and propose a deep convolutional neural
   network architecture that recovers scene depth directly from
   dual-frequency, raw ToF correlation measurements. To train this
   network, we simulate ToF images for a variety of scenes using a
   time-resolved renderer, devise depth-specific losses, and apply
   normalization and augmentation strategies to generalize this model
   to real captures. We demonstrate that the proposed network can
   efficiently exploit the spatio-temporal structures of ToF
   frequency measurements, and validate the performance of the joint
   multipath removal, denoising and phase unwrapping method on a wide
   range of challenging scenes.
