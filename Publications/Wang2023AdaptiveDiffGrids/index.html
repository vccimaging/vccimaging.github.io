<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<b>Motivation:</b> Tilt-series cryo-Electron Tomography is a powerful tool widely used in structural biology to study three-dimensional structures of micro-organisms, macromolecular complexes, etc. Still the reconstruction process remains an arduous task due to several challenges: The missing-wedge acquisition, sample misalignment and motion, the need to process large data, and especially a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). <br>
<b>Results:</b> Inspired by the recently introduced neural representations, we propose an adaptive learned-based representation of the density field of the captured sample. This representation consists of an octree structure, where each node represents a 3D density grid optimized from the captured projections during the training process. This optimization is performed using a loss that combines a differentiable image formation model with different regularization terms: total variation, boundary consistency, and a cross-nodes non-local constraint. The final reconstruction is obtained by interpolating the learned density grid at the desired voxel positions.<br>
The evaluation of our approach using captured data of viruses and cells shows that our proposed representation is well-adapted to handle missing-wedges, and improves the SNR of the reconstructed tomogram. The reconstruction quality is highly improved in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, while using the lowest computing time footprint.<br>
