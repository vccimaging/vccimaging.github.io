<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
We present a novel learning-based framework for reconstructing 3D structures from tilt-series cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) data.
Cryo-EM is a powerful imaging technique that can achieve near-atomic resolutions. Still, it suffers from challenges such as missing-wedge 
acquisition, large data size, and high noise levels. Our framework addresses these challenges by using an adaptive tensorial-based representation 
for the 3D density field of the scanned sample. First, we optimize a quadtree structure to partition the volume of interest. Then, we learn a 
vector-matrix factorization of the tensor representing the density field in each node. Moreover, we use a loss function that combines a 
differentiable tomographic formation model with three regularization terms: total variation, boundary consistency constraint, and an isotropic 
Fourier prior. Our framework allows us to query the density at any location using the learned representation and obtain a high-quality 3D tomogram. 
We demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods using synthetic and real data. Thus, our framework boosts the quality of the 
reconstruction while reducing the computation time and the memory footprint.<br>
