X-ray tomographic reconstruction of a rose undergoing 
  significant wilting during the scan due to loss of water. Images
    (<b>a</b>) and (<b>b</b>) show photographs of the rose directly
  before and directly after the scanning process. Traditional CT
  reconstruction (<b>c</b>) from all 5520 projections in the scan
  sequence show significant distortions due to misalignment of
  features. When grouping the projections into 92 frames of 60
  projections each (<b>d</b>), the deformation over each frame
  becomes negligible, but now the number of projections per frame is
  insufficient for high-quality reconstruction of the corresponding
  volumes (<b>e</b>, <b>Y</b>). By comparison, our full space-time
  reconstruction algorithm yields a time sequence of highly detailed
  volumes for different time steps (<b>f</b>, <b>Y'</b>). <br><br>
    
<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
X-ray computed tomography is a valuable tool for analyzing objects
with interesting internal structure or complex geometries that are not
accessible with optical means. Unfortunately, tomographic
reconstruction of complex shapes requires a multitude (often hundreds
or thousands) of projections from different viewpoints, which can only
be achieved with mechanical motion. This significantly limits the
ability to use x-ray tomography for either objects that undergo
uncontrolled shape change at the time scale of a scan, or else for
analyzing dynamic phenomena, where the motion itself is under
investigation.<br>
In this work, we present a non-parametric space-time tomographic method
for tackling such dynamic settings. Through a combination of a new CT
image acquisition strategy, a space-time tomographic image formation
model, and an alternating, multi-scale solver, we achieve a general
approach that can be used to analyze a wide range of dynamic
phenomena. We demonstrate our method with extensive experiments on
both real and simulated data.
