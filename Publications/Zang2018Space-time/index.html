X-ray tomographic reconstruction of a rose undergoing 
  significant wilting during the scan due to loss of water. Images
    (<b>a</b>) and (<b>b</b>) show photographs of the rose directly
  before and directly after the scanning process. Traditional CT
  reconstruction (<b>c</b>) from all 5520 projections in the scan
  sequence show significant distortions due to misalignment of
  features. When grouping the projections into 92 frames of 60
  projections each (<b>d</b>), the deformation over each frame
  becomes negligible, but now the number of projections per frame is
  insufficient for high-quality reconstruction of the corresponding
  volumes (<b>e</b>, <b>Y</b>). By comparison, our full space-time
  reconstruction algorithm yields a time sequence of highly detailed
  volumes for different time steps (<b>f</b>, <b>Y'</b>). <br><br>
    
<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a valuable tool for
analyzing objects with interesting internal structure or complex
geometries that are not accessible with optical means. Unfortunately,
tomographic reconstruction of complex shapes requires a multitude
(often hundreds or thousands) of projections from different
viewpoints. Such a large number of projections can only be acquired 
in a time-sequential fashion. This significantly limits
the ability to use x-ray tomography for either objects that undergo
uncontrolled shape change at the time scale of a scan, or else for
analyzing dynamic phenomena, where the motion itself is under
investigation.<br>
In this work, we present a non-parametric space-time tomographic method
for tackling such dynamic settings. Through a combination of a new CT
image acquisition strategy, a space-time tomographic image formation
model, and an alternating, multi-scale solver, we achieve a general
approach that can be used to analyze a wide range of dynamic
phenomena. We demonstrate our method with extensive experiments on
both real and simulated data.
    
<h3 id="results">Main results</h3>
<h4>Wilting rose</h4>
A rose undergoing significant wilting was scanned during 9.5 hours.<br> 
<img src="result_rose.png" width="100%"/> <br> <br>
    
<h4>High viscosity fluid flow</h4> 
This experiment corresponds to the flow of a high viscosity transparent fluid over a 3D-printed mold.
This fluid, with 20 million times the viscosity of water, has several included air bubbles that move and pop as the fluid fills the mold.<br>
This flow was scanned during 2 hours and 12 minutes. <br>

<h4>Rising dough</h4>
This rising dough is made from flour and yeast. A hazelnut is placed inside this dough, in order to have additional internal structures.<br>
The process was scanned during 4 hours and 27 minutes.<br>
