<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
 Time-of-flight depth imaging and transient imaging are two imaging
  modalities that have recently received a lot of interest. Despite
  much research, existing hardware systems are limited either in terms
  of temporal resolution or are prohibitively expensive. Arrays of
  Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) promise to fill this gap by
  providing higher temporal resolution at an affordable
  cost. Unfortunately SPAD arrays are to date only available in
  relatively small resolutions.

  In this work we aim to overcome the spatial resolution limit of SPAD
  arrays by employing a compressive sensing camera design. Using a DMD
  and custom optics, we achieve an image resolution of up to
  800$\times$400 on SPAD Arrays of resolution 64$\times$32. Using our
  new data fitting model for the time histograms, we suppress the
  noise while abstracting the phase and amplitude information, so as
  to realize a temporal resolution of a few tens of picoseconds. <br><br>
