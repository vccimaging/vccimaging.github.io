<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive technique with
a large array of applications in clinical imaging and biological
tissue visualization. However, the presence of speckle noise affects
the analysis of OCT images and their diagnostic utility. In this article, we 
introduce a new OCT denoising algorithm. The
proposed method is founded on a numerical optimization framework based on 
maximum-a-posteriori 
estimate of the noise-free OCT image. It combines a novel speckle noise model, 
derived from local statistics of empirical spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) data, 
with 
a Huber variant of total variation regularization for edge preservation. The 
proposed approach 
exhibits satisfying results in terms of speckle noise reduction as well as 
edge preservation, at reduced computational cost. <br><br>
