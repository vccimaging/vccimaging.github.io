<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>Deflectometry, as a non-contact, fully optical metrology method, is difficult to apply to refractive elements due to multi-surface entanglement and precise pose alignment. Here, we present a computational self-calibration approach to measure parametric lenses using dual-camera refractive deflectometry, achieved by an accurate, differentiable, and efficient ray tracing framework for modeling the metrology setup, based on which damped least squares is utilized to estimate unknown lens shape and pose parameters. We successfully demonstrate both synthetic and experimental results on singlet lens surface curvature and asphere-freeform metrology in a transmissive setting.</p> <br><br>
