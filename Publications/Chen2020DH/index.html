The scheme of the in-line holography system, (b) The results of the proposed method, and (c) the
PBHolo-Net scheme. Here the input of the network is the captured holography image; the output is the restored
3D data; oi denotes the restored 3D object of the i-th stage; and vi denotes the auxiliary variable in the i-th stage. <br><br>
  
<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
We propose a physics-based holographic network (PBHolo-Net) for threedimensional
imaging. Due to the involvement of the wavefield propagation, the network
is efficient, stable, and can perform more precise hologram reconstruction.

Note: This is a failure trying on the holographic 3D imaging, please refer <a href="/Publications/Chen2021TCI/">here</a> for another sophisticated implementation.
