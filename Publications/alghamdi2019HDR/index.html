Overview of the proposed HDR imaging system. In hardware a binary optical mask is placed near the image sensor to achieve spatially
varying exposures (top left). In reconstruction we first devise a casual one-time calibration network to accurately estimate the mask
(bottom left), and then input the raw noisy color filter array (CFA) image and estimated mask to our HDR reconstruction network to obtain
the final HDR image. The HDR-VDP-2 visibility probability maps for our result (right-top), blue indicates unperceivable differences,
which means that our system can recover a high quality HDR image from a single raw LDR image. <br><br>
  
<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
High Dynamic Range (HDR) image acquisition from a single image capture, also known as snapshot HDR imaging, is challenging because the
bit depths of camera sensors are far from sufficient to cover the full dynamic range of the scene. Existing HDR techniques focus either
on algorithmic reconstruction or hardware modification to extend the dynamic range. In this paper we propose a joint design for snapshot
HDR imaging by devising a spatially-varying modulation mask in the hardware as well as building an inception network to reconstruct the
HDR image. We achieve a reconfigurable HDR camera design that does not require custom sensors, and instead can be reconfigured between
HDR and conventional mode with very simple calibration steps. We demonstrate that the proposed hardware-software solution offers a 
flexible yet robust way to modulating per-pixel exposures, and the network requires little knowledge of the hardware to faithfully 
reconstruct the HDR image. Comparison results show that our method outperforms state of the art in terms of visual perception quality. <br><br>
