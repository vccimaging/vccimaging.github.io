<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
 High-dynamic range (HDR) imaging is an essential imaging modality for 
 a wide range of    applications in uncontrolled environments, including
 autonomous driving, robotics, and mobile phone cameras. However, existing 
 HDR techniques in  commodity devices struggle with dynamic scenes due to 
 multi-shot acquisition and post- processing time, e.g. mobile phone burst 
 photography, making such approaches unsuitable for real-time applications. 
 In this work, we propose a method for snapshot HDR imaging by learning an 
 optical HDR encoding in a single image which maps saturated highlights into 
 neighboring unsaturated areas using a diffractive optical element (DOE). 
 We propose a novel rank-1 parameterization of the proposed DOE which avoids 
 vast trainable parameters and keeps high frequencies' encoding compared with 
 conventional end-to-end design methods. We further propose a reconstruction 
 network tailored to this rank-1 parametrization for recovery of clipped 
 information from the encoded measurements. The proposed end-to-end framework 
 is validated through simulation and real-world experiments and improves the 
 PSNR by more than 7 dB over state-of-the-art end-to-end designs. <br><br>
