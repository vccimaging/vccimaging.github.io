Set up: Extinction imaging and planar laser induced incandescence setup (PLII). The extinction setup consists of a pulsed LED going through 2 Fresnel lenses and a diffuser captured by an SA-Z fast camera. PLII was captured using an ICCD camera.  <br><br>
    
<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
Soot is a natural byproduct of incomplete combustion and is detrimental to human health and the environment. 
Previous experiments in simple canonical flames typically provide point or 2D measurements to support the development of improved soot models. 
In this letter, we introduce a new diagnostic able to obtain instantaneous 3D soot volume fraction and with the potential to obtain instantaneous 3D velocity fields in a turbulent flame. 
To achieve these results, extinction images were simultaneously acquired at three angles around the flame. 
A specialized space-time tomographic method was used to reconstruct 3D velocity fields and 3D extinction coefficients. 
From the local extinction coefficients, local soot volume fraction can be derived. 
The reconstructed soot fields were compared to a single shot planar laser-induced incandescence (PLII) image of the soot field synchronized with the final extinction measurement. 
Qualitative results between the image slice corresponding to the PLII shot were in good agreement with the corresponding tomographic reconstruction slice.
