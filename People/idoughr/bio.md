Ramzi IDOUGHI joined King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in 2016 as Postdoctoral fellow at Visual Computing Center (VCC), working with Professor Wolfgang Heidrich. He is a member of Computational Imaging Group.<br />
Dr. Ramzi IDOUGHI received his Ph.D. in 2015, from [ONERA (the French Aerospace Lab)](http://www.onera.fr/en/) and the [University of Toulouse](http://en.univ-toulouse.fr/research-phd), [ISAE (Toulouse, France)](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/).<br />
His research interests lie in signal and image processing, inverse problems and optimization for applied physics issues.<br /> Currently, he is principally working on a new approach (Rainbow Particle Imaging Velocimetry) for dense 3D fluid velocity imaging. Moreover, he is involved on a project on improving the quality of captured OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) data.
