Ramzi IDOUGHI joined King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in 2016 as Postdoctoral fellow at Visual Computing Center (VCC), working with Professor Wolfgang Heidrich. He is a member of Computational Imaging Group.
Dr. Ramzi IDOUGHI received his Ph.D. in 2015, from ONERA (the French Aerospace Lab) and the University of Toulouse, ISAE (Toulouse, France).
His research interests lie in signal and image processing, inverse problems and optimization for applied physics issues. Currently, he is principally working on a new approach (Rainbow Particle Imaging Velocimetry) for dense 3D fluid velocity imaging. Moreover, he is involved on a project on improving the quality of captured OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) data.
