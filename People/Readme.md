# Individual Home Directories

Each directory corresponds to a home directory of a single person. The following requirements exist:

- the directory name should match the ```id``` field for that person in the people database ```/_data/people.yaml```
- an ```index.html``` or ```index.md``` file should exist, and represent the start of the home page (additional pages are possible)
- for the page to be linked to the global list of lab members, the file ```published``` should exist inside the directory. It can be empty, but if it does not exist, the page will not be linked automatically.
