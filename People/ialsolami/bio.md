KAUST is a fascinating global university/town. The community at KAUST is represented by more than 100 nationalities. Among all of my friends at KAUST, who come from all corners of the world, I surely have the most boring story: I am from a [village](https://www.google.com.sa/maps/search/maps/@22.4458387,39.5221629,4845m/data=!3m1!1e3) that is just half an hour's drive from KAUST.


I did my PhD at [Oxford University](http://www.ox.ac.uk), master’s degree at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), and bachelor’s degree at [KFUPM](http://www.kfupm.edu.sa/default.aspx). I worked as an electrical engineer at [Saudi Aramco](http://www.saudiaramco.com/en/home.html) and did my co-op at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com). My current research focuses on both theoretical and experimental analysis of time-of-flight imaging in the photon counting regime.
