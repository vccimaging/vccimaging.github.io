My research interests lie at this exciting confluence of Computer Graphics and Computer Vision, where they reinforce each other to 
achieve realism in both analyzing and synthesizing the beautiful visual world surrounding us. I am particularly interested to understand
the complex way in which the appearance of real or virtual world objects changes under variable illumination, viewpoint and pose. 
To this end, I strive to develop novel and efficient algorithms to better extract, represent and regenerate visual information 
from photographs/images.
