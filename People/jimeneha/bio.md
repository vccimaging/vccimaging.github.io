Hector Jimenez is currently pursuing his Ph.D. in Applied Physics at the Visual Computing Center at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). He works under the guidance of Professor Wolfgang Heidrich and is a member of the Computational Imaging Group.

Hector completed his bachelor's degree in Physics with a minor in Mathematics from the Instituto Politecnico Nacional in Mexico in 2012. Following that, he worked as the manager of the optics lab at Holomex, a holographic security company in Mexico City, Mexico, from 2013 to 2021. He also taught science at Centro de Estudios Científicos y Técnologicos 9 (CECyT 9), a high school affiliated with the Instituto Politécnico Nacional, in Mexico City, Mexico, from 2014 to 2020.

In 2020, Hector earned his MS degree in Physics from the Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana in Mexico City, Mexico. He joined KAUST in the same year as a Ph.D. student at the Computational Physics and Material Science Lab (CPMS), where he focused his research on simulating the behavior of electrons in atoms under electromagnetic fields. Presently, Hector's research interests revolve around various aspects of imaging technology, including computational imaging, optical design, and fabrication, as well as optimizing end-to-end imaging systems.
