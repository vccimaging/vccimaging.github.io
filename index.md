## Test

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

### Overview

The main research focus of the group is Computational Photography and Display, an emerging research area within Visual Computing, which combines methods from Computer Graphics, Machine Vision, Imaging, Inverse methods, Optics and perception to develop new sensing and display technologies.

Our work aims to develop new cameras and imaging modalities that optically encode information about the real world in such a way that it can be captured by image sensors, as well as new computational displays for glasses free 3D or high-contrast (HDR) content.
