# Computational Imaging Group

Todo: some image

### Overview

The research focus of the group is Computational Photography and Display, an emerging research area within Visual Computing, which combines methods from Computer Graphics, Machine Vision, Imaging, Inverse methods, Optics and perception to develop new sensing and display technologies.

Our work aims to develop new cameras and imaging modalities that optically encode information about the real world in such a way that it can be captured by image sensors, as well as new computational displays for glasses free 3D or high-contrast (HDR) content.
